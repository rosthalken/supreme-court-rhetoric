Monologic Voice: 
The monologic voice broadly describes how a Supreme Court Justice centers themself or the Court in the text of an opinion
Justices may use the monologic voice for different goals, both individually and collectively:
Individual
Emphasizing their own virtue/capabilities
Describing their past stances on previous cases
Casting disdain on other Justices/the majority Court
Presenting their own jurisprudential approach (judicial philosophy)
Collective (speaking for the Court)
Emphasizing the Court’s capabilities/importance in American law
Describing what the Court should/shouldn’t do
Presenting the Court as responding to a higher power (law or constitution)



Often uses words like: 
We, I, our, us, Court, task, duty, seek,  opinion, judgment, responsibility, obligation, conscience, test, judge, reasoning, astonishing, view, believe, hold, think, should

Note: You may find that a lot of the labeling comes down to whether or not there's a personal pronoun--and that's okay! What matters is that you’re still thinking about the function of the entire sentence; not just the personal pronoun.



Examples: 
“We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy… Our task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection. We seek earnestly to do this, and, because we do, we have inquired into, and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, medical and medical legal history and what that history reveals about man's attitudes toward the abortion procedure over the centuries”

““In my opinion, the judgment this day rendered will, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this tribunal in the Dred Scott case.”

““So it was clear to me then, and it is equally clear to me now”

“It would be inconsistent with our place in the constitutional scheme were we to sanction more expansive remedies in a judicially created cause of action in which liability is without fault than Congress has allowed in cases of death resulting from negligence.”

“Our activist tendencies should promote not law and order, but constitutional law and order.”

Monologic w/out pronoun: “It can never be emphasized too much that one's own opinion about the wisdom or evil of a law should be excluded altogether when one is doing one's duty on the bench.”



Be careful with the following (that are NOT the monologic voice):
References to other “Courts” 
Reference to self/Court that’s only a function of getting something else across
“The term "navigable" has at least the import of showing us what Congress had in mind as its authority for enacting the CWA: its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made.”
